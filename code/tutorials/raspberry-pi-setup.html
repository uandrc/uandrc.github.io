<h1>How to Set Up a Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>A Raspberry Pi is a small computer. Here is how to start using one.</p>
<em>For simplicity, this tutorial assumes you are using a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or above (among
    the most common models). Setup for other Raspberry Pis varies slightly, but generally follow
    the steps listed below.</em>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi (wow!)</li>
    <li>Unused (formatted) micro SD card*</li>
    <li>USB-C or Micro USB Power supply (dependent on Raspberry Pi model)</li>
    <li>HDMI or micro HDMI cable (dependent on Raspberry Pi model)</li>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <li>Keyboard (not needed for the Raspberry Pi 400, which is built inside a keyboard)</li>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Monitor power supply</li>
</ul>
<em>*<strong>Important</strong>: The micro SD card will be overwritten in the OS-installation
    process. Ensure there is
    absolutely nothing you will miss on the card before proceeding!</em>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Install and run <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi
        Imager</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Insert your micro SD card into your computer.</li>
    <li>If you are not familiar with Linux, select <em>"Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)"</em> as your
        chosen
        OS. Otherwise, select an OS of your choosing*.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the micro SD card from your computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the Raspberry Pi and the other end into the
        monitor.*
    </li>
    <li>Plug the mouse and keyboard into the Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Plug the monitor into its power supply.</li>
    <li>Plug the Raspberry Pi power supply into an outlet.</li>
    <li>Turn the monitor on, then connect the Raspberry Pi with its power supply.</li>
    <li>Wait for the Raspberry Pi to boot.</li>
</ol>

<!-- change the below two notes to footnote citations, like in latex or wikipedia sources
when you click on the citation note they anchor down to the source below -->

<em>*Note: If your Raspberry Pi has two HDMI ports, plug your main monitor into the HDMI0
    port.</em>

<em>Note: Raspberry Pi Imager allows you to select a custom .img file for your Pi's
    OS. This enables you to install Windows 11 and other OS on your Raspberry Pi.</em>

<h2>Turning a Raspberry Pi off</h2>
<p>Turning a Raspberry Pi on is as simple as pie: you plug it in. However, turning a Raspberry
    Pi off is not as simple as unplugging it while it is on. In fact, doing so can cause
    the micro SD card to corrupt and break your OS.
</p>

<p>To properly turn your Raspberry Pi off:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
    <li>Enter the following command: <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code></li>
    <li>Wait for the screen to go completely black (this may take several seconds, be
        patient!)
    </li>
    <li>Unplug your Raspberry Pi from its power source.</li>
    <li>Turn off your monitor.</li>
</ol>

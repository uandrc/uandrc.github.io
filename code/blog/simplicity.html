    <h1>Simplicity</h1>
    <h3>Why it's so great</h3>

    <p>
        There's an intrinsic beauty to simplicity. In the world of programming, there's even
        an acronym for it. KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) was coined by the Department of Defense to
        remind hardware and software engineers that systems are least error-prone when kept simple.
        Similarly, "worse is better" states that having simpler, "worse" programs with less
        functionality can be superior to programs with more user options.

        Simplicity is great because it reminds us to focus on the most important task at hand.
        It is too easy to get caught up in trivial details trying to make something look good,
        only to neglect the bigger, more important picture. To make something useful <em>and</em>
        simple is a powerful skill. It is a skill that programmers and non-programmers alike should
        strive to hone.

        By today's standards, the UI of many apps from the past are a little ugly - rough around the
        edges - sometimes literally, with pixelated buttons and muted colors. Yet, their charm seems
        to exceed many "beautiful", modern apps. Is some of this charm based solely on nostalgia, as
        opposed to its artistic merit? Absolutely.

        EDIT THIS
        Yet, there's something so special about using an old app. I attribute this feeling to the
        tendency for older apps to be very simple. They lack the bells and whistles we are so
        accustomed to seeing today. Older programs' focus on the core functionality, as opposed to
        the , makes apps reduce the mental load clients must take on to use the app.

        One of the best examples of greatness from simplicity is Apple iMovie's mobile device
        software. I've tried many editing softwares across several operating systems over several
        years. Most that I've used have worked well, but it is easy to be overwhelmed by the
        plethora of options and settings that so frequently plague editing softwares.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Apple iMovie focuses on the most important
        editing functions: cut, crop, simple transitions, text overlay, speed adjustment, audio
        levels, filters, and voiceover. For most functions, there's only a handful of options that
        can be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that is what makes iMovie on mobile so great. It does not have clutter or waste hogging
        up the screen. iMovie's simplicity lends itself extremely well to being hassle-free.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, it is often a necessary for simplicity to be compromised for more powerful
        functionality. There's a reason practically no professional YouTuber uses Apple iMovie
        to edit their videos: it is way too simple! It does not offer the functionality required
        to make stunning effects, because it strives to be simple.
    </p>

    <p>
        The takeaway is: simplicity should be prioritized. To have more may come at the
        cost of simplicity - but you'd better try to minimize that cost as much as you can.

        Terry A. Davis, the exceptionally talented programmer who created Temple OS, said,
        <q>An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.</q>
        The point stands clear: Keep it simple, stupid!

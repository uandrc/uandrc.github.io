    <h1>Model, View, Controller</h1>
    <h3>A Great Design Pattern</h3>

    <p>
        When I was learning to program, I learned to separate my classes.
        Intuitively, it made sense to isolate the logic side of code from the display side of it.
        This is the classic backend/frontend structure used by most apps. However, when I learned
        about the MVC design pattern, I began to understand how much separation was truly needed
        to make code as maintainable as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        The MVC structure is as such:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            (M)odel: Contains core code logic
        </li>
        <li>
            (V)iew: Contains anything the user will view (CLI/GUI)
        </li>
        <li>
            (C)ontroller: Controls the behavior of the model and view
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In MVC, the model and view are kept completely isolated from each other. Each package does
        not know the other exists.
    </p>

    <h1>Why so Plain?</h1>
    <h3>Why "boring" HTML pages are good</h3>

    <p>
        Take a look at the following screenshots of several university webpages:
    </p>

    <p>
        UC Riverside: <!-- their C code guide here -->
        Purdue: <!-- insert jerusalem artichoke article here -->
        <!-- Find some super html-ly website, maybe from stanford or smthing -->
    </p>

    <p>
        You have likely noticed a pattern. All of these university websites are plainer than a
        slice of white bread.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I first noticed this pattern of plainness, I was confused. Why would universities with
        the ability,
        money, and resources stoop to such low website-viewing standards? Surely a couple decades
        would be ample time to make their website at least a <em>smidge</em> prettier, no?
    </p>

    <p>
        However, while many universities indeed have ability, money, and resources, their websites'
        questionable stylistic choices are rooted in good reasons.

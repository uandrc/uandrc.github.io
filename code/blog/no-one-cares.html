    <h1>No One Cares</h1>

    In general, no one cares about you. They care what you have to offer to them.

    This applies to:
    <ul>
        <li>Code:
            Users don't care how elegant your functions are. They don't even know they exist.
            They only care whether what you've made works.
        </li>

        <li>Journalism:
            Inverted pyramid structure.
        </li>

        <li>YouTube:

        </li>

    </ul>

    People are result-oriented. This is not necessarily a bad thing - at the end of the day,
    if something doesn't work, it is a problem.

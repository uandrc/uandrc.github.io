    <h3>Message Protocol</h3>
    AndrcMail uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a>
    to access email. This means that the emails associated with your Gmail account are synced with
    AndrcMail. In other words, any emails you send, delete, receive, etc. in AndrcMail will also
    be visible as sent, deleted, or received in Gmail.

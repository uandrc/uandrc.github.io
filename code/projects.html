    <p>
        <em>(Not shown)</em> Andremal: A portmanteau of "Andrew" and "malware", Andremal is a
        highly realistic simulator of the WannaCry ransomware GUI. I built this program out of
        a fascination of WannaCry's UI design and to learn its encryption algorithm.
        Although Andremal <em>does not</em> encrypt files or cause <em>any</em> damage to a
        computer, I am not
        providing the link to this project (unfortunately, it only takes one bad actor to make
        a harmless project like this one illegal and destructive).

        Besides the plants shown above, I've also grown:<br>
        Catnip, Basil, Habanero,
        Rhubarb, Plum Tomatoes, Alpine strawberries, Dwarf potted sunflowers, Jerusalem artichoke,
        Miner's Lettuce, Butterhead Lettuce, Aloe Vera (and many other succulents), Lychee, Welsh
        Onions, Shallots, Potatoes, Radishes, Purslane, Carrots, Ice plants, and more.
        While they are not biologically defined as plants, I've also grown 1 lb. of oyster mushrooms
        from a Home Depot bucket. That was very fun!

        I love my indoor plants; in my room, I have grown:
        <ul>
            <li>Two "ZZ" plants for about four years.</li>
            <li>Pothos ivy (which now <a href="">climbs the walls of my uni dorm</a>)</li>
            <li>Baby rubberplant (watch me transplant it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e852SndtNQI">here</a>)</li>
        </ul>

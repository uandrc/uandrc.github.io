        While they are not biologically defined as plants, I've also grown 1 lb. of oyster mushrooms
        from a Home Depot bucket. That was very fun!

        I love my indoor plants; in my room, I have grown:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two "ZZ" plants for about four years.</li>
        <li>Pothos ivy (which now <a href="">climbs the walls of my uni dorm</a>)</li>
        <li>Baby rubberplant (watch me transplant it <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e852SndtNQI">here</a>)
        </li>
    </ul>
